# Tailsaw: Saber Blog Starter Template

This is a starter template for creating a beautiful, customizable blog in Saber with minimal effort. It is based on the [Blog Template](https://github.com/tightenco/jigsaw-blog-template) for Jigsaw. See the [demo](http://saber-theme-tailsaw.netlify.com/).

### Adding Content

You can write your content using a variety of file types. Your content is located in the `pages/_posts/` folder.

The top of each content page contains a YAML header that specifies how it should be rendered. The `title` attribute is used to dynamically generate HTML `title` and OpenGraph tags for each page. The `layout` attribute defines which parent layout this content file will render with (e.g. `post` will render with `theme/layouts/post.vue`).

```yaml
---
title: First Post
layout: post
date: 2019-04-29
author: Jane
categories:
  - meta
slug: first-post
cover: /cover-1.png
featured: true
---

```

---

### Adding Assets

You can easily include assets in your posts, just by [linking to their relative location](https://saber.land/docs/images-fonts-and-files.html). Cover images need to be located in the `public` folder for now, until [frontmatter asset loading is implemented](https://github.com/egoist/saber/issues/80).

## Building Your Site

Now that you know how to customize your content, letâ€™s build the site.

```bash
yarn build
```

Your built site is under `.saber/public/`.
